### What is this repository for? ###
It is currently dubbed OSFO short for [Our Store Front Online]

* Problem Niche
- The Global Corona Virus Pandemic has impacted all industry sectors and local Manufacturing, Retail and Distrubtion sectors
have taken a significant loss due to safety measures implemented by the govt. to mitigate / lessen the health risks posed by the Novelty.
- Business downsizing due to loss projections tiggered by stay at home regulations
- Social Distancing Guidelines require consumers to be a certain distance apart from each other, creating lines that are essentially too long adding a space shortage factor to the problem

* Core Concept OSFO
The Idea is that most eCommerce solution currently on the market requires that a customer sign / register a payment method 
and subsequent transactions for that customer is tied to same. OSFO removes that extra step for local consumers so you can check out 
without the requirement to process a payment before order fulfilment. Instead the platform processes the order, sends it to the merchant which recieives the order for fulfillment, the consumer is then alerted with their order status that would show invoice amount, line items filled and instructions / options for payment and pickup / delivery.
